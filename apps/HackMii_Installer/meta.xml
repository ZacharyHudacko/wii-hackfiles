Upon launching the HackMii Installer, you will be greeted by a scam warning screen. After waiting 30 seconds the message “Press 1 to continue” should appear, then press 1.
Note: If the "Press 1 to continue" message doesn't appear, or you get a "no vulnerable IOS" error message or any other issues with the installer, try installing a stock version of IOS58 and try again. Or you can use ModMii's "Hackmii Solutions" option to accomplish the same thing.
